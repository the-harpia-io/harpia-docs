Technical flow to process alerts:**\\n- [harp-collectors](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-collectors): receive alerts from monitoring system, unify the structure and push them to Kafka topic\\n- [harp-alert-decorator](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-alert-decorator): read alert from Kafka topic (produced by harp-collectors) and add additional info about environments and scenarios that should be applied to the alert\\n- [harp-daemon](https://github.com/the-harpia-io/harp-daemon): read alert from Kafka topic (produced by harp-alert-decorator), describe the logic and state of the alert and write result to MariaDB\\n- [harp-aggregator](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-aggregator): read alerts from MariaDB, aggregate it and send to Aerospike\\n- [harp-bridge](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-bridge): read alerts from Aerospike and send to UI via websockets\\n- [harp-ui](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-ui): the main user interface of the platform\\n\\n\\n**2. Additional Services:**\\n- [harp-filters](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-filters): create and manage the user specific filters in UI\\n- [harp-actions](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-actions): manage alerts - handle, snooze, acknowledge\\n- [harp-environments](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-environments): create and manage environments\\n- [harp-bots](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-bots): configure your own bots to send auto notifications to different channels - Email, SMS, Slack etc..\\n- [harp-integrations](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-integrations): create and manage the integrations with your monitoring systems\\n- [harp-licenses](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-licenses): monitor the usage of the alerts and notification channels\\n- [harp-scenarios](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-scenarios): create and manage scenarios for alerts\\n- [harp-users](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-users): create and manage users inside platform including authentication and authorization\\n- [harp-notifications-gmail](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-notifications-gmail): responsible to send auto email notifications\\n- [harp-notifications-msteams](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-notifications-msteams): responsible to send auto notifications to Microsoft Teams\\n- [harp-notifications-slack](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-notifications-slack): responsible to send auto notifications to Slack channel\\n- [harp-notifications-sms](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-notifications-sms): responsible for creating auto SMS notifications via Twilio integration\\n- [harp-notifications-telegram](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-notifications-telegram): responsible to send auto notifications to Telegram channels\\n- [harp-notifications-voice](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-notifications-voice): responsible for creating auto Phone Calls via Twilio integration\\n- [harp-clientevents](https://github.com/harpia-io/harp-clientevents): receive and analyze metrics from the frontend\\n\\n**3. Platform Monitoring**:\\n- Prometheus metrics in VictoriaMetrics\\n- Traces in Grafana Tempo\\n- Logs in Grafana Loki\\n- Dashboards and Alerts in Grafana\\n\\n### Conclusion\\nWe look forward to working with you to make our incident management system the best it can be for the water industry!"}]}')}}]);
